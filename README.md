Quote Generator
This project is a simple Quote Generator that fetches a list of quotes from an API and displays a new quote each time the "New Quote" button is clicked. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and visually appealing interface.

Features
Random Quote Display: Retrieves a random quote from a list of quotes fetched via a REST API and displays it on the page.
API Integration: Uses a REST API to get an array of quotes, each containing a quote text and author.
Interactive Button: A "New Quote" button that, when clicked, shows a different random quote from the fetched list.
Responsive Design: Styled with CSS to ensure a clean and responsive interface on various screen sizes.
Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the structure of the application.
CSS: Used for styling and enhancing the visual layout.
JavaScript: For accessing the API and handling the display of random quotes.
REST API: Fetches quote data, which is stored in an array and accessed by the application.
Getting Started
To run the project locally:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Click the "New Quote" button to view a random quote.
How It Works
When the page loads, the JavaScript code fetches a list of quotes from an API.
The list of quotes is stored in an array, apiQuotes.
When the "New Quote" button is clicked, the app selects a random quote from apiQuotes and displays it on the screen.
